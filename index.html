            <p>My name is Siyanda Makhalima, born and raised in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. I went to University of the Western Cape, were i studied BSc Computer Science(degree). I dropped out in my second year due to financial issues and I had hard times concentrating is the lecture. I was doing Java as main language, but also did a 6 Month on Python. After dropping out I opened an internet cafe for which has been running for almost 3 years now. On 2018 I joined Codex and the beggining of the year, where I learned about web developing. I am now a newbie web developer and progressing each and everyday.<br> <strong>My main goal is to be a <em>Full stack developer</em><strong>.</p>

                     <p>A useful resource for the software/web development community, CodeBetter has a fairly technical focus. Also, in their words, their content focuses on “building up” rather than “tearing down,” meaning that rather than critiquing the flaws of certain techniques or tools, they are more interested in keeping the site positive and finding ones that work.</p>

                     <p>Their almanac is where you should go to learn all things CSS, but despite the site name, CSS-Tricks covers more than one thing. While CSS is still, understandably, what the bulk of the content is about, the blog has published articles on JS, jQuery, PHP, and pretty much all things web development. Chris Coyier is the founder and writes most of the posts (1856 at last count!).</p>
